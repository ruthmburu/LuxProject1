# Instagram TV (IGTV) Product Success Measurement

## Overview
This repository contains the project files and documentation for measuring the success of the Instagram TV (IGTV) product, conducted as part of my role as a Product Data Scientist at Instagram.

## Project Description
As a Product Data Scientist at Instagram, it's crucial to evaluate the performance and impact of new features like IGTV. This project aims to establish a framework for measuring the success of IGTV by analyzing various metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs). By understanding how users engage with IGTV content and how it contributes to Instagram's overall user experience, we can make data-driven decisions to enhance the product.

## Methodology
In this project, we will employ a combination of data analysis, statistical techniques, and machine learning to measure IGTV's success. The methodology includes the following steps:
- Data Collection: Gathering relevant data related to IGTV usage and user engagement.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring data patterns and visualizing insights.
- Key Metrics Definition: Defining the essential metrics and KPIs to evaluate IGTV.
- Hypothesis Testing: Performing statistical tests to validate findings.
- Machine Learning Models: Building predictive models to forecast IGTV trends.
- Reporting and Visualization: Communicating results through clear and informative visualizations and reports.

## Results
The findings and results of this project will be documented and shared in this repository, providing insights into IGTV's success and its impact on Instagram's ecosystem.

## How to Use
This section will include instructions on how to reproduce the analysis, use the code, and interpret the results. It will also include any prerequisites or dependencies.
